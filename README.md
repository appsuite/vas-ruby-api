# vFabric Administration Server Ruby API

The vFabric Administration Server (VAS) API is a Ruby library used for interacting with the
[vFabric Administration Server](http://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/vfabric-vas.html).

VAS's primary mode of interaction is via RESTful interface. This API enables the use of VAS using
rich Ruby types, eliminating the need for a detailed understanding of the REST API and its JSON
payloads.

## Requirements

The VAS Ruby API requires Ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.x. It has been built and tested on 1.8.7 and 1.9.3.

## Installation

The VAS Ruby API is not yet available on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/). However, pre-built
gems can be [downloaded](https://github.com/vFabric/vas-ruby-api/downloads) and installed. For
example:

	gem install vas-<version>.gem
